# More TNT Datapack

## Description

The More TNT datapack adds in 13 NEW types of TNT to Minecraft, without any mods or plugins! All you need to get this to work is the datapack and the resourcepack. These new TNTs can be crafted in survival and on servers, leading to amazing PvP battles and more fun, with a vanilla feel. You can get these with commands, or craft them with the NEW custom crafter. Make sure to enable both the datapack AND resource pack for this to work!

### TNT List

Fire TNT, Bats TNT, Sponge TNT, Nuclear TNT, Levitation TNT, Icy TNT, Throwable TNT, Fireworks TNT, Health TNT, Charged TNT, Nether TNT, Ender TNT

***

## Obtaining (read carefully)
To obtain these new TNTs, you will have to craft a TNT workbench, which is where all the new TNTs are crafted. You can craft the TNT workbench by dropping a crafting table and an iron block on the floor. Each variation of TNT has its own unique recipe, which is shown in the recipe list below. (When I get back from holiday, I will add a tutorial video, screenshots and a better description.) To craft a TNT, open up the TNT workbench by right clicking on it, and arrange the items in the correct order. Then, the items will get taken and you will have a new, freshly crafted TNT! **If you just want to get all the TNTs instantly, run /function #tnts:get_all, or to just get a specific TNT, run /function tnts:tntname/get.**

### Recipe List (for the TNT Workbench)
- Fire TNT: Put a TNT in the middle, and surround it with Fire Charges

## Usage

Using the TNTs is the same as using a normal TNT, just set it on fire, wait for the fuse to run out, and then it will explode. Each new TNT explodes differently. The Throwable TNT can't be placed down like a block, you can throw it by holding it and then using it with right click. The Nuclear TNT will take a bit longer to explode (10 seconds).

## Uninstalling 
To uninstall the datapack with no problems, you need to do the following things in the correct order
1. Reload the datapack with /reload
2. Run the command /function tnts:destruct. This will remove all TNTs from the world.
3. Remove or disable the datapack.
4. Remove or disable the texturepack.

If you do not do those things in the right order, you may have glitchy mobs and random blocks and items everywhere.
